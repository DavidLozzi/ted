# TeD
our squad team holds Technology Elaboration &amp; Design Session, or TeDs. here we design what we're going to build next sprint with a few squads. sometimes we get ahead of ourselves and derail other meetings on content that should be saved for the TeD. this little project is an attempt to have some fun around encouraging the teams to wait for Ted.
